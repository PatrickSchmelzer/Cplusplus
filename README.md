# Interview Preparation Guide

## 14 algorithm patterns
Most common algorithms used in interview coding questions
### 1. Sliding Window
	Identifications:
	- Input linear data structure such as linked list, array or string
	- Longest/Shortest substring/subarray or desired value
	Common problems:
	- Maximum sum subarray of size 'K' (easy)
	- Longest substring with 'K' distinct characters (medium)
	- String anagrams (hard)
	
### 2. Two Pointets or Iterators
	Identifications:
	* Sorted arrays (Linked lists), need to find an element that fulfill certain constraints
	* Set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet or even a subarray
	Common problems:
	* Squaring a sorted array (easy)
	* Triplets that sum to zero (medium)
	* Comparing strings that contain backspaces (medium)
	
### 3. Fast and Slow pointers
	Identifications:
	* The problem deal with a loop in a linked list or array
	* Position of a certain element of overall length of the linked list
	* Singly linked list (no moving backwards) i.e. for linked list palindrome
	Common problems:
	* Linked List Cycle (easy)
	* Palindrom Linked List (medium)
	* Cycle in a Circular Array (hard)
	
### 4. Merge Intervals
	Identifications:
	* produce a list with only mutually exclusive intervals
	* overlapping intervals
	Common problems:
	* Interval intersections (medium)
	* Maximum CPU load (hard)
	
### 5. Cyclic sorted
	Identifications:
	* Problems involving a sorted array with a number in a given range
	* missing/duplicate/smallest number in a sorted/rotated array
	Common problems:
	* Find the Missing number (easy)
	* Find the Smallest Missing Positive Number (medium) 

### 6. In-place reversal of linked list
	Identifications:
	* Rerverse a linked list without extra memory
	Common problem:
	* Reverse a sub-list(medium)
	* Reverse every K-element sub-list (medium)
	
### 7. Tree BFS
	Identifications:
	* Traverse a tree in a level by level fashion (or level order traversal)
	Common problems:
	* ZigZag Traversal (medium)
	
### 8.Tree DFS
	Identifications:
	* Handling of nodes (PreOrder, InOrder, PostOrder)
	*Searching where the node is closer to a leaf
	Common problems:
	* Sum of Path Numbers (medium)
	* All Paths for a sum (medium)
	
### 9. Two Heaps
	Identifications:
	* Priority Queue, Scheduling
	* Smallest/largest/Medium element of a set
	* Featuringa binary tree data structure
	Common problems:
	* Medium Number of a Number Stream(medium)
	
### 10. Subsets
	Identifications:
	* Combinations or permutations of a given set
	Common problems:
	* Subsets with Dubplicates (easy)
	* String perumations by changing case (medium)
	
### 11. Modified binary search
	Common problems:
	* Order-agnostic Binary search (easy)
	* Search in a sorted infinite array(medium)
	
### 12. Top K elements
	Identifications:
	* Smallest/top/Frequent K elements of a given set
	* sort an array to find an exact element
	Common problems:
	* Top K Numbers (easy)
	* Top K Frequent Numbers (medium)
	
### 13. K-way Merge
	Identifications:
	* sorted arrays, lists or matrix
	* merge sorted lists, smallest element in a sorted list
	Common problems:
	* Merge K Sorted Lists (medium)
	* K Pairs with Largest Sums (Hard)
	
### 14. Topological Sorted
	Identifications:
	* graph no directed cycles
	* update all objects in a sorted order
	* class of objects that follow a particular order
	Common problems:
	* Task scheduling (medium)
	* Minmum height or a tree (hard)
